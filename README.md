# Automated-Testing-Exercise-DemoSite
This repo contains an exercise that demonstrate the use of Selinium and Cucumber Testing.

The task is to create a user within a demo website and then login as the user. Once this is complete, asserting that the task was successful. 

Selinium in conjunction with Cucumber is a great way to automate front end testing. The Pseudo code approach of Cucumber using the "Given, When, Then" approach helps to organise and understand the code better. This allows for the incorporation of Behaviour Driven Develeopment.
